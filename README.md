##README


The following description is about the installation of the Pseudo Doodle project

###Installation

So, the only thing you need to do, is to upload the SQL-dump to your localhost, and you can run the Project right from the **app/index.html** page.
This requires a PHP5 WAMP/LAMP/MAMP server with phpmyadmin usage. On the import page you can give in the file URL, and then it's alright. Some date is included, so you can use it.

###Features

This program features the things that a usual Doodle poll includes. I tried to mimic it, but some UX development is yet on the road until now.
Two additional JS Libraries are involved: Datepicker, and TimePicker Bootstrap.

A mailsender feature is also under development, so you could surely alert your friends about the existence of the poll!

The whole project is inserted into a beautiful Bootsrtap environment!
